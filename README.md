#### Barcode
1. limited capacity of information
2. weak fault-tolerant system

#### QR code
1. large capacity of information(support all types of words)
2. small space
3. strong adaptability to getting dirty and damaged

#### Reason:
1.  dense urban areas & heavy ridership to stay profitable
2.  huge workforce to spread the bikes to the most needed areas


#### Accessibility and convenience requires two things:
1. huge fleet of bikes
2. huge workforce to spread the bikes to the most needed areas

#### China:
1. massive urban population
2. large, cheap labor force
3. support from gov



## Future
